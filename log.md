# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!-- 
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've created a GitHub repo for a JS library which perform "synchronized" events on a webpage

**Thoughts:** I'm slowly settling down. Two new things I'll explore : first JS library I'm creating / contributing to + first use of ES2015 only. I will start mixing both ES5 and ES2015 and refactoring while I'm getting confortable with ES2015.

### Day 2: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've quickly enable NPM on the library

**Thoughts:** Following this eggshead tutorial (https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-creating-the-library-and-adding-dependencies) I've added support to NPM. Less than one hour of code but as tomorrow I'm off I'll be able to balance today's lacks.

**Link to work:** same repo than Day 1


### Day 2: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've built the architecture for the project

**Thoughts:** I kinda dropped off the eggshead tutorial in order to spend more time building actual code. I did an OOP structure which went quite smooth.
