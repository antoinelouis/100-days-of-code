# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've created a GitHub repo for a JS library which perform "synchronized" events on a webpage

**Thoughts:** I'm slowly settling down. Two new things I'll explore : first JS library I'm creating / contributing to + first use of ES2015 only. I will start mixing both ES5 and ES2015 and refactoring while I'm getting confortable with ES2015.

### Day 2: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've quickly enable NPM on the library

**Thoughts:** Following this eggshead tutorial (https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-creating-the-library-and-adding-dependencies) I've added support to NPM. Less than one hour of code but as tomorrow I'm off I'll be able to balance today's lacks.

### Day 3: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've built the architecture for the project

**Thoughts:** I kinda dropped off the eggshead tutorial in order to spend more time building actual code. I did an OOP structure which went quite smooth.

### Day 4: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Managed to trigger events at the desired timing

**Thoughts:** Worked for the click event and used smoothscroll to simulate scroll.

### Day 5: April 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Code the hover event

**Thoughts:** Faced some serious difficulties, because of the `isTrusted` property on the events that is not possible to hack:

Found as a fallback the possibility to get the CSS `:hover` properties and apply them directly on the element.

### Day 6: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: factorize the hover event

**Thoughts:** I start to doubdt about the architeture I set up for the key construction. I eventually managed to simulate all the style of the hover effect.

### Day 7: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Manage the after hover event

**Thoughts:** Just a dumb style reset. I really need to add a cursor.

### Day 7: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a moving cursor

**Thoughts:** Although I can't move it to the right position. I might need some sleep.
